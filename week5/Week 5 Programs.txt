Explanation: There is a triplet (5, 3 and 1) present  
in the array whose sum is 9. 
 
15. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that 
appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element). 
Examples :  
 
Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4} 
Output : 4 
Explanation: The frequency of 4 is 5 which is greater than the half of the size of the array size.  
 
Input : {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4} 
Output : No Majority Element 
Explanation: There is no element whose frequency is greater than the half of the size of the array size. 
 
16. Write a program in C to copy the elements of one array into another array.

32. You are given an integer 'n' which denote the number of elements in an array a[ ]and an integer 'x'. You 
have to calculate the average of element a[i] and x and find out if that number exist in array or not. Do it 
for all the elements of array and store the count result in another array for each index i.

Output: 10 15 20 25 30 
 
Input: n=2, a={12 , 2} 
Output: 12, 7 
 
34. Given an array of even size, task is to find minimum value that can be added to an element so that 
array become balanced. An array is balanced if the sum of the left half of the array elements is equal to the 
sum of right half. 
 
N = 6, a={1 2 1 2 1 3} 
Output: 2 
Explanation: Suppose, we have an array 1 2 1 2 1 3. The Sum of first three elements is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 and sum 
of last three elements is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 
So this is unbalanced, to make it balanced the minimum number we can add is 2 to any element in first half.
