11. Write a C program to find the next date of the given input date. The input is taken into 3 
different variables d, m and y representing date, month and year. The sample input and outputs are 
given below. If any invalid date is given as input, print “Invalid Input”.  
 
 
Input: 10 12 2022  Input: 31 1 2022  Input: 28 2 2022
